This is for testing purposes only. DO NOT USE ON OTHER INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT PERMISSION. 
You agree to this by using the program.
You have been warned!


---

Before starting:
Make sure you have the Arduino program installed on a computer, with the digispark libiaries installed.
Before you can start the process of creating the DigiSpark script, make sure you have installed our custom "DigiKeyboard.h" file, which is located in the same folder as the actual Arduino script on the GitHub page. (The folder which this file should be replaced should be under AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\digistump\hardware\avr\1.6.7\libraries\DigisparkKeyboard - Google search if you don't know how to do it)

You should now be ready to begin the process of creating a Meterpreter script to your Digispark with the ANES-meterpreter script

---

Use anes.py script in linux terminal with Meterpreter installed (not included in script)

Take output-file and upload to a webserver

Make digispark download file from webserver in the arduino script (see arduino script for instructions)

Connect digispark to victim's computer

In kali linux, follow the instructions on-screen, and check that the session is open

Connect to victim's computer, make sure properly injected (WinTerminal closes and all programs minimizes)

Do "help" for list of commands

For more information and help, open a issue and let us know. :)
